# Linux System Programming
The purpose of this repo is to capture the important tenants of Linux System Programming as reference and as a platform for exploring and expanding my personal knowledge.

The contents of this repo is inspired by the Udemy class Linux System Programming - A Progammer's Practial Approach by Mohan M.  I highly recommend this class for beginners, intermediates, or anyone who needs a refresher (like me).

# Organization
I'm using a single main function and commented lines to invoke the specific system-level function calls.  Some functions may require the creation or deletiong of a file to see the expected results.  When this is the case, I added comment to the function explaining what is required.
